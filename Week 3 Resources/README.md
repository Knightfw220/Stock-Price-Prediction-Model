# Week 3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Neural Networks

Let's finally get started with neural networks! 

Neural networks are a class of machine learning techniques in which a computer learns to perform a task by analyzing training examples. They are pivotal in machine learning, serving as dynamic models that learn intricate patterns from data

## PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is a flexible and dynamic library, making it a popular choice for researchers and developers working on machine learning and deep learning projects.
